Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ‚Ä≤ hole.

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Manlius NY</h3>

Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines.</p>

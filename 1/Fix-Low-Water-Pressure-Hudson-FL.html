<p>The usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house (developed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Numerous toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not require repairing the entire toilet. Like any home device, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that might need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

<p>Conditioned or softened water is great for your household's health. Make gas connections with solid steel pipe (Photo 8) or soft copper with flare fittings (Fig. A).

<h3>How to Repair Kitchen Faucets in Morrison IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

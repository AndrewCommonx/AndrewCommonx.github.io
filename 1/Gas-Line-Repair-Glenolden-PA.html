<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The unit must grind the waste even finer to prevent clogs and allow the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but needs to then shift to galvanized. I am unsure why that need to be. It is also enabled to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finishing (which is generally a special paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your new disposal.

To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention steps need to be maintained on-site at all times throughout building. Short-lived water will be allowed after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be connected to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser must be strongly attached to strong rebar or wood stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is considerably complete is prohibited unless a double check backflow assembly is installed and instantly evaluated to assure it is working.</p>

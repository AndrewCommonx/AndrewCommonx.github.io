<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently equivalent, though replacement typically will not need added fees, such as application costs. New meters must meet guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers might require an unique meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the structure license. Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will provide a violation notification, and a particular period of time is set aside to fix the issue.</p>

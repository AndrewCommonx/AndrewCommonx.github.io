This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is required to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be unwise in many circumstances to install a pipe section of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>

Sediment buildup: This is among the most common reasons for hot water heater problems. It can reduce warm water flow and result in tank deterioration. In a lot of cases, sediment can be flushed out. We suggest annual flushing to keep your tank without abrasive components.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>

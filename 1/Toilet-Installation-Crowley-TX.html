<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow of water which may bring dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the general public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of circumstances that may draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

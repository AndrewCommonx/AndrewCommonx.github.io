<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

A gas heater also needs a little bit more to appropriately maintain throughout the years than an electric heater will. In the end, the costs conserved for many years will more than cover the expenses of water for a bigger family. Smaller sized families and people might do better with an electric water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as explained in the area below.</p>

Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging pollutants.

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to leave. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>

Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>

<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Washougal WA</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely cracked and merely requires to be changed.</p>

<p>Disc: Found in both restrooms and cooking areas, disc faucets are recognizable by a single lever which carries on a broad, round body. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing tough water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its brand-new place and put there.

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>

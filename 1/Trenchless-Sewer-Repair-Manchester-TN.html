Some jurisdictions likewise allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

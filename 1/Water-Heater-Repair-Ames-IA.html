<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. But is a plumbing disaster imminent or simply a concern for the long run?

We'll reveal you one method to make each connection, however there are other equally genuine methods using typical plumbing parts.

<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found prevalent use since it avoids both siphonage and back pressure.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at expected functional pressure to flow through. Need to backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>

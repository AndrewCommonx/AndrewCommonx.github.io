<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and break or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

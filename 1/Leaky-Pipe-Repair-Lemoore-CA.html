It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

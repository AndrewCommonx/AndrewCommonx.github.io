<p>Installation and replacement expenses are frequently similar, though replacement typically will not require additional charges, such as application charges. New meters should satisfy policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies may require an unique meter for their services, restricting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the structure authorization. Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will issue an offense notice, and a particular amount of time is set aside to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). Inspect the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

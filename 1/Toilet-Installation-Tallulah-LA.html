<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>

<p>Removing or lowering water firmness is finished with a piece of equipment called a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is consisted of various parts, each having their own unique function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is typically described.

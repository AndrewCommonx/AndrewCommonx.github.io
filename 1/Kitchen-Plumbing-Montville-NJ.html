<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing skills if you're reasonably inexperienced. So save yourself some major difficulty by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is. The majority of backflow preventers are created to allow the elements to be gotten rid of for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system.

The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>

To prevent such an event, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention technique utilized. The very best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture).

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>

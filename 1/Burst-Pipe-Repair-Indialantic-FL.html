Somebody might have flushed something they shouldn't have down the toilet or your pipes have built-up residue and need cleaning. If your plunger can not deal with the problem, then you may need a professional plumber to fix the clog for you.</p>
<p>On top of the cost of the actual disposal, the majority of garbage disposal installers charge a per hour rate and can set up a waste disposal unit in a couple of hours. Removing an old waste disposal unit does take additional time, but all the necessary plumbing and electrical circuitry will currently be in place for setting up the new one. Continuously needing repairs will begin to get expensive, a brand-new gas line will solve your problems if you are always experiencing gas leakages.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

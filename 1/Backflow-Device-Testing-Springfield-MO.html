<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for a given application and which are worn or broken and require replacement must be replaced by a backflow preventer which does comply to the guidelines for the given application.

A plumber will insert a specially created water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to determine where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

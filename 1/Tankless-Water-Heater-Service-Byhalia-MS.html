Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

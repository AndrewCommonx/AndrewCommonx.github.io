The flapper isn't sealing under normal pressure if pressing down on the flapper stops the noise.

It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially true when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

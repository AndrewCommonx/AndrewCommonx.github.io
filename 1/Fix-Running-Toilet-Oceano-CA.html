<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

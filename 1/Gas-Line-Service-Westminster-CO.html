Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, energy, or crawlspace  room is fairly uncomplicated, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage.

<p>She understood about the service call cost. The 4 In Your Corner Examination discovered that's a common cost. Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would offer a price quote over the phone. All of them wished to look at the situation prior to devoting to a price, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>

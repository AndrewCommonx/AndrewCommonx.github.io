<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and offer brighter clothing and softer skin using a healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without having to include salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no drainage, no salt and no electrical power or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance because the media can last up to 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>

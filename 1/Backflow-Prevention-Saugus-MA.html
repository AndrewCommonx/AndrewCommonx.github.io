Many individuals do not treat their garbage disposals appropriately, which can lead to all sort of issues. This, in turn, can not just result in the garbage disposal no longer operating efficiently or correctly, however can also result in issues with other fixtures and plumbing units.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.

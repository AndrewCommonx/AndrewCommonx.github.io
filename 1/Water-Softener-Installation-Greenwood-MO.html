<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Greenwood MO</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.

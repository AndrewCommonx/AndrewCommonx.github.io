<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home uses a septic system and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and enable the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then transition to galvanized. I am uncertain why that need to be. It is likewise permitted to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized covering (which is essentially an unique paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>

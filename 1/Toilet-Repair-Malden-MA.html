This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>When a Notice of Correction" or Notification of Requirement" is issued, failure to install or remedy an installation and then evaluate a backflow assembly may result in service interruption or termination.

When needed, newer systems use computerized sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore just restore.

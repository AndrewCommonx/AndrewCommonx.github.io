<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

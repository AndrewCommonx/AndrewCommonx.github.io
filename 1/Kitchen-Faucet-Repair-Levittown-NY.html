<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>

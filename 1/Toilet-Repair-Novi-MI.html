<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>

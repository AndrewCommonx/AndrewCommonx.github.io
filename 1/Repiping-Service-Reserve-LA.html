Consequently residential authorizations released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked each year. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the watering system.

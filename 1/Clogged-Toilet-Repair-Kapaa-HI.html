Common water heater problems consist of cold or warm water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The cause of these problems can be challenging to recognize, so it is essential to employ a professional plumbing contractor who is familiar with the understanding required to find the problem and make the proper repairs.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>

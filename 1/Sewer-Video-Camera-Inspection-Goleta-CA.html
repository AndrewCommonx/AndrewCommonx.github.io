I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

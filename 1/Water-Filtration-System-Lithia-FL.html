<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads become filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these symptoms.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has currently been fouled. Once again, it is recommended to check the producer's directions for unique preventative measures.</p>

Due to the strengths of PVC, it is among the most widely used plastics in the world.</p>

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. An RPBA is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to isolate health or non-health threats.</p>

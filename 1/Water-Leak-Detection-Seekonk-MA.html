It helps to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The brand name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can become a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers sometimes attempt 2 or three flappers prior to they discover one that works well.</p>

You need to constantly run cold water into the waste disposal unit while squashing foods. Cold water solidifies greases that have been discarded. This makes it simpler for the system to break them up.</p>

About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used during the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work simply fine, however if your toilet is really old (and outdated in design), you may wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

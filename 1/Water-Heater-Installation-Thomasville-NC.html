<p>For the purpose of water treatment, firmness is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is defined as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert between gpg and ppm use the list below element; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water actually needs it. Newer systems use computerized sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other crucial metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just regrow when required.

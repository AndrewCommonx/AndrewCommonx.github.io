Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.

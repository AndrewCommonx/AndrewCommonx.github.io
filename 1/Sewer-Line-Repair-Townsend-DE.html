<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Townsend DE</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>

<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Providence UT</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous intended usages around your home.</p>

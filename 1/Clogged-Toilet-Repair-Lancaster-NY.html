<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Lancaster NY</h3>
<p>This is an entirely legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, naturally, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nevertheless, it includes a reasonable amount of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly small round device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>

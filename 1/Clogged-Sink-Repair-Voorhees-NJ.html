Double flush valves are becoming more and more common, as both customers and producers look for brand-new methods to save water.

If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people find that squicky - therefore the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just utilizing less water to do it.</p>

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>

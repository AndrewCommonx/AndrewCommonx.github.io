<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>And depending upon the setup of your home, the plumber may be able to access the vast majority of your system in this manner. For a 1,500 square-foot, two-bathroom home, you'll pay in between $2,000 and $6,000 or more to replace simply the exposed plumbing.

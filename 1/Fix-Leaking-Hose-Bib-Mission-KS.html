I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

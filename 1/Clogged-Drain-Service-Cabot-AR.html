<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Regardless of whether it is an electrical water heater or a gas hot water heater, Premier Plumbing has actually offered hot water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roadways area since 1978.</p>

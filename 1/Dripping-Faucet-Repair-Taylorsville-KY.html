Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>

<p>To assist avoid blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the approach laid out above. Because the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>Salt intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or environmental factors require restricting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be suitable. Over time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regrowth procedure can be scheduled immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>

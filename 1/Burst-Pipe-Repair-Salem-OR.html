<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Salem OR</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply.

So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>

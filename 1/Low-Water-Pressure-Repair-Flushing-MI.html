<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close.

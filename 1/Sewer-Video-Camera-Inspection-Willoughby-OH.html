A fouled # 2 Examine Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the directions. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

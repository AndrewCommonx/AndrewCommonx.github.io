<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

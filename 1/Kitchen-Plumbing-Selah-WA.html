Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide a quote over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the scenario before dedicating to a cost, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>

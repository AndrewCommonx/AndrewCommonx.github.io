As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally regrowed.</p>

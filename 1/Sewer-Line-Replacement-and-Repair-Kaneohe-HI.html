<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>

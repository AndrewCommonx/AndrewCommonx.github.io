I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.

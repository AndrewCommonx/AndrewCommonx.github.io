<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service might look like a waste of money. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners might be an inexpensive service, the harsh ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, with time, producing weak points in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and crack or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

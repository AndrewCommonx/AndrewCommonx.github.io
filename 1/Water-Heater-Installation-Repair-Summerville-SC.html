Pressure vacuum breakers utilize a check valve designed to close with the help of a spring when water flow stops.

<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Tough water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>

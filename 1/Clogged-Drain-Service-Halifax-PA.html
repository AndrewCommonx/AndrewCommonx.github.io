Unbreakable Clogs: Professional assistance is the best remedy, if you discover yourself provided with a particularly stubborn clog.

As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and crack or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place.

We highly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

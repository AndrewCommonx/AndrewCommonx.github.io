<p>Those of us in the market understand that cross-connection programs in many areas have greatly decreased the variety of reported occurrences that occur within our water supply. This has at times resulted in people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever really have been a problem in the first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and detrimental. Backflow events in water systems are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it provides and then install the correct protection.</p>

Usually speaking, it's best to have a professional plumber inspect your backflow preventer at least once a year to guarantee it's working properly.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.

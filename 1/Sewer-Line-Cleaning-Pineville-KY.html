<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

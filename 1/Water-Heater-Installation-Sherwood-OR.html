<p>Replace what's exposed.

Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a utility, basement, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

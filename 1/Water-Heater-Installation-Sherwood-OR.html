<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a utility, basement, or crawlspace  room is fairly straightforward, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

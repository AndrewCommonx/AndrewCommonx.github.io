<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to identify if and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which include gases and liquids. A lot of plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, in addition to some technical direction, each year. Technical instruction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. Most apprentices get in a program directly, however some start as assistants or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. A lot of water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

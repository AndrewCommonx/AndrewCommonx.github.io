<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Springfield KY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>

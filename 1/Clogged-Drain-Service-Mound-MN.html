WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually offer more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit optimal capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused.

<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. Newer systems utilize computerized sensors that keep an eye on bead depletion and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and therefore only regenerate when needed. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>

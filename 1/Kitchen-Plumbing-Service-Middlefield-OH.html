<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might very well belong to your job requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which attracts the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure known as, ion exchange).

Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>

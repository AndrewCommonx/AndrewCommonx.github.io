<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need an unique garbage disposal. The system should grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, however needs to then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that should be. It is likewise enabled to utilize black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized finish (which is basically an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>

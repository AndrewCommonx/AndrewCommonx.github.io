<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>

Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.)

For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

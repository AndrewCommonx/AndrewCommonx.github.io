When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>

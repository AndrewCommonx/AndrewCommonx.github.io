This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to separate the clog.

<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't require fixing the entire toilet. Like any home device, a toilet tank includes many little moving parts that may need replaced with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

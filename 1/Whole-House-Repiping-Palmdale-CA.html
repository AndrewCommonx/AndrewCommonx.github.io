<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being greater than the supply pressure. This decrease in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Waste disposal unit service warranties last an average of 5 years, however they can vary between 2 and 10 years. Given that the average lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might want to purchase an extended warranty. A lot of service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures. To prevent further breakdowns, house owners need to stay up to date with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>

Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from entering the garbage disposal, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>

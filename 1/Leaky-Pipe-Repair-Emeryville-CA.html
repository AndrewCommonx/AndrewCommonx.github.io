<p>The garbage disposal is humming, but not turning. The garbage disposal has actually become jammed. NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL if IT IS JAMMED. Even if the unit is off, the blades are dangerous and sharp. Make sure the system is off, you can even switch off the breaker to make certain it can't be switched on by accident. Your garbage disposal features a. hex wrench that can be utilized to insert into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. Attempt to insert a broom handle or plunger into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel if you can't locate this wrench.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

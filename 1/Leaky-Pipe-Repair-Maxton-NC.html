<p>Reducing or removing water solidity is done with a tool known as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange procedure takes place. A softener is comprised of different parts, each having their own unique function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is typically described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most fundamental type has an electrical timer that flushes and recharges the system on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

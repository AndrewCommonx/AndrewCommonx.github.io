Our premium system, the EC4 entire house water softener, is a cutting edge product that utilizes a procedure of ion exchange to get rid of the minerals that cause tough water. By replacing the magnesium, bicarbonate, and calcium ions that cause water firmness with sodium or potassium ions, the EC4 softens tough water by resolving its source. In addition, thanks to its unique, built-in microprocessor, the EC4 system will learn your common water use patterns, adjusting its soft water delivery based on your needs. In this method, our premium water softener makes sure that you'll have a limitless supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>

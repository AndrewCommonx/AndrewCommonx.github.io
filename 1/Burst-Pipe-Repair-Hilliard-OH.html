<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Hilliard OH</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

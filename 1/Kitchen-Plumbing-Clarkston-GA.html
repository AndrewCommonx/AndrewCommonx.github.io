Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be checked every year. Likewise allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an every year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system.

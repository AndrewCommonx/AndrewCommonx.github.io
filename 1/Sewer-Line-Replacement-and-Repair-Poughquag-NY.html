<p>You can find great deals of repair instructions on the internet, so the very first thing you need to understand is that for anything beyond a frustrating drip-drip-drip you should close the shutoff valves underneath to save water and protect versus the leak unexpectedly becoming worse while you're sleeping or away.

<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur.

Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not properly protected. Backflow Preventer definition: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions.</p>

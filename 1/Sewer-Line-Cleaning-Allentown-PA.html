<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

<p>It might a few weeks to entirely repipe your whole house if you have a huge home and don't employ enough contractors. If you reside in a cold-weather environment, we highly recommend repiping your house throughout spring or summer so you do not have to worry about freezing temperatures throughout the repiping process. Typically, if the problem is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is likely the best solution.

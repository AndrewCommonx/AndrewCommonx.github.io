<p>Cross-linked polyethylene or PEX pipes are a type of plastic pipe that is chosen for repiping plumbing lines, as they're versatile, flexible, and can suit any area. Setting up a new gas line in the kitchen will normally range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your house to gas, or if the existing line is at capability, expect to invest $2,000 or more.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>

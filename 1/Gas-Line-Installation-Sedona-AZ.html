<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the store.

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and solidify or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>

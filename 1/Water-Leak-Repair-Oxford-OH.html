<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

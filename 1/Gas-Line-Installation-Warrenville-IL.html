<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>

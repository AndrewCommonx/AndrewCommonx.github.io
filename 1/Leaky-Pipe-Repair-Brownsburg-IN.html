<p>Toilets are one of those plumbing fixtures that we frequently consider granted-- they're lasting, resilient, and pretty consistently there for you when you need them. Similarly, toilets take up such a large part of your bathroom that many people are starting to take them into account when updating their bathroom style choices. However that doesn't mean toilets are best-- gradually they will need to be fixed when something goes wrong, and they may even ultimately need to be changed. Whether you're aiming to fix or install a new toilet up the one you have so it works like new again, you can depend on the Sterling plumbers from Donmar Heating, Cooling & Plumbing to finish the job.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

A fouled # 2 Examine Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge.

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds.

As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>

The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave.

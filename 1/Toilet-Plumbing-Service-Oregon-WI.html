<p>It is important that you address any and all problems that you discover in the home's plumbing system (or elsewhere in the house, for that matter) with the seller or realtor prior to making an offer or closing the sale. While lots of homes come with a house warranty that will cover the various systems within the home for a specific amount of time, you can still be out of pocket if the plumbing system is in disrepair and your house becomes damaged as an outcome.

<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers need to just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>

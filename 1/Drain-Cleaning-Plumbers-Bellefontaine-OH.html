<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or simply an issue for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home costs $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floorings, so you certainly don't want to get the job done before it's essential.

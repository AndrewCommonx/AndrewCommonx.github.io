<p>Salt-free systems will also reduce scale accumulation and provide brighter clothes and softer skin using a much healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to include sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative effect on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt material in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no drainage, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last up to 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>

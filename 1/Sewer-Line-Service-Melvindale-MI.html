<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Low Water Pressure - Low water pressure is the leading concern with a lot of homes and company' alike. Merely said it is difficult to get casserole dishes or any large serving piece clean with no pressure in the faucet or sprayer. Mineral deposits are also a significant culprit, clogs from food bits, clogs in aerator screens all certainly stop water flow. The most major could be water leaking, blocked lines to the cut off, or perhaps worse a frozen pipe coming into your home or building.</p>

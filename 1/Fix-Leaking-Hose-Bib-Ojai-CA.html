<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they normally occur in the most affordable open drain. This type of problem is usually the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you don't identify the smell originating from the sewer backup, you may recognize this problem due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with just that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage problem.</p>

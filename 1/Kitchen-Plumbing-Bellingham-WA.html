<p>Have a look at the hot water heater repair and installation services we provide. Our mission at Brennan Heating & Air Conditioning is to make certain that our Bellevue customers have reliable hot water whenever they need it. The CareSoft ® system was developed with the very same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that provides high-performance firmness elimination you can depend on for years to come. It's quite typical for particles to wind up being flushed down our drains. Think of how often food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks. After adequate time, these items may build up into obstructions, which can obstruct the circulation of water throughout a house. This can lead to a number of problems, from foul smells to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes destructive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the green and blue discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with special venting systems also are readily available. But they're harder to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>

<p>The garbage disposal is humming, but not turning. The waste disposal unit has become jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL. Even if the system is off, the blades are dangerous and sharp. Ensure the unit is off, you can even shut off the breaker to ensure it can't be turned on by accident. Your waste disposal unit includes a. hex wrench that can be utilized to place into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. Attempt to place a broom plunger or handle into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench. If it seems to be moving easily turn the unit back on (and do not forget to turn back on the breaker if you don't it off) and see if the unit is working.</p>

If you see nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist right and left. If the motor spins easily, examine that the breaker hasn't tripped and after that attempt the reset button.

<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

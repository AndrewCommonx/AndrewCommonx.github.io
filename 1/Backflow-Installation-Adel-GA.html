<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>To assist avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the method laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

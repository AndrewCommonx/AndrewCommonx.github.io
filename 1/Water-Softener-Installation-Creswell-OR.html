<p>Regular causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, obstructions (such as foreign items, bathroom tissue, grease, and other debris), wear and tear, and broken seals or joints between areas of sewer line.

When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a client's natural gas pipe or related connections, repair expenses can be high.</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized.

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

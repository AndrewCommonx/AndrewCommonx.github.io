Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

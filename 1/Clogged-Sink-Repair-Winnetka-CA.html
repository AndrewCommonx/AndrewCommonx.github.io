This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline.

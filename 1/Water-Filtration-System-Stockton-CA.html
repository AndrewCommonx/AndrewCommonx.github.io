<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

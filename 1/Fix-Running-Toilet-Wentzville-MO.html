<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Wentzville MO</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>There are additional problems that might come up, which is why our knowledgeable plumbers will carry out a thorough inspection of your unit to determine what has actually triggered it to malfunction. From there we can make a notified choice on whether your issue can be resolved by a simple repair or if changing the garbage disposal is ultimately the much better choice. You must consider changing them if you have old metal drain pipes covered in rust. Examine the rusted areas for leaks given that this is commonly where they're discovered.</p>

Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole.

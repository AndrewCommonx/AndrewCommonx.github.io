<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>

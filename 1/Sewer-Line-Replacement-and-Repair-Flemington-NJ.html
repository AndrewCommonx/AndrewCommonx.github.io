A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water circulation.

<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in many locations have significantly reduced the number of reported incidents that take place within our water supply. This has at times led to people believing that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever truly have been an issue in the very first place. This thinking can be both counterproductive and dangerous. Backflow events in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow defense. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and then install the proper protection.</p>

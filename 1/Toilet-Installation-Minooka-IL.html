Single traps shall be set up, whenever possible, within 5 feet of the outside of exterior walls. Some disposals are connected to the dishwasher, which allows for self-cleaning. This location often struggles with leaks too. This could be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines.</p>

<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

<p>The term hard water describes water with a high mineral material. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the nation you remain in, but most commonly consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Difficult water does not begin hard-- instead, it picks up mineral deposits as it can be found in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits remain when the water is routed into pipes for residential and commercial usage, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>

<p>A. We strongly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or negative pressure in your watering system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, therefore lowering the threat of contamination of your water source. Many municipalities require the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip irrigation systems. You might wish to contact your local municipality prior to installing your irrigation system.</p>

<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

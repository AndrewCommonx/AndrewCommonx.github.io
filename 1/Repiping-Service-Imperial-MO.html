The majority of pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices generally receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. A lot of apprentices enter a program directly, but some start out as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>

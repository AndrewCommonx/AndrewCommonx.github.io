<h3>Blocked Drains in Lambertville MI - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

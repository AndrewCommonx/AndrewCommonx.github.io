If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and industrial applications, including the prevention of limescale accumulation in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, as well as improving current reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is easier and more cost-efficient than other softening systems on the marketplace today that utilize zeolites, which must be restored using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water usage and high pressure.</p>

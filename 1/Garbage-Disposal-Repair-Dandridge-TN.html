<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the directions. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water in fact needs it. More recent systems use computerized sensing units that monitor bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water use and therefore only restore when needed. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>

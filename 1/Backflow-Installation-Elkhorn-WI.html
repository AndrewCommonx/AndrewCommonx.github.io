<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Elkhorn WI?</h3>
<p>If you are updating your gas home appliances, you should upgrade the piping as well. Gas leakages can be scary and unsafe. We're here for you every step of the method. Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a consultation. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly defined by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional usage, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

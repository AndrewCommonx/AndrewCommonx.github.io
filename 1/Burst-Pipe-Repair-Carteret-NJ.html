<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>

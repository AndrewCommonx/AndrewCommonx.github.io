<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>

It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

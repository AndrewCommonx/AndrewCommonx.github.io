<p>She learnt about the service call charge. The 4 On Your Side Investigation found that's a common fee. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would offer a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance prior to dedicating to a price, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>

<p>The nationwide typical cost to repair a dripping faucet is $65-$ 150, however the cost may be higher, depending on the nature and reason for the leak. Common water heater problems include lukewarm or cold water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The reason for these issues can be hard to identify, so it is essential to employ a professional plumbing contractor who recognizes with the understanding required to locate the issue and make the proper repairs.</p>
<p>Obstructions are easily prevented with a few key actions. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible.

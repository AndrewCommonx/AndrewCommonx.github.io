<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>

Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Albuquerque NM</h3>

Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in the majority of homes and represent over 30 percent of total household water consumption. Toilets made prior to the 1980s might consume to 7 gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the task and still wasting water. Later on designs from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

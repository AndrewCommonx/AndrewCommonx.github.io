If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can infect the water system.

<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

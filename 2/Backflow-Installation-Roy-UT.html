<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>For commercial centers consisting of hotels, universities, and dining establishment chains, problems with a hot water heater can have a huge effect on daily operations and must be prevented whenever possible.

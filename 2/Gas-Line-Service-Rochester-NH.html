<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You might have to check out utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>

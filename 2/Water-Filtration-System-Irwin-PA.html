<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found prevalent use since it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and operate individually of each other. A set of four test cocks permit the operator to analyze the valves and ensure they are not being forced open by collected particles. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at expected functional pressure to stream through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, avoiding the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>

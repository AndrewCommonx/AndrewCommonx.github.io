<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk contains the earliest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had changeable and easily detachable sections, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>

<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the technique laid out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

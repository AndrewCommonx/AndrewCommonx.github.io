We had some family coming to stay for graduation weekend and we needed a new hot water heater prior to they arrived. We searched for a bit, however we got the best quotes from Blue Frog. They had the ability to send out someone out within a day approximately. He was very friendly and great. He said our expenses should be lower now too.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and break or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak.

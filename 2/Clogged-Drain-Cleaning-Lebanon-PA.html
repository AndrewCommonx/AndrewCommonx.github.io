<p>Trees and shrubs are a common reason for sewer blockages to the house. Roots can turn into the smallest crack or gap in your home's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient rich environment supplied by the sewer. Flat roofing systems generally have drains spaced out around their boundary.

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>

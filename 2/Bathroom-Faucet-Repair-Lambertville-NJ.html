Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in many homes and accounts for over 30 percent of overall household water consumption. Toilets made before the 1980s might consume to 7 gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the job and still squandering water. Later models from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

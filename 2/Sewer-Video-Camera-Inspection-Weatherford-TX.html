Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue.

Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Double Examine Valve - Design GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a disrobed Check Valve without turned off valves and test cocks.

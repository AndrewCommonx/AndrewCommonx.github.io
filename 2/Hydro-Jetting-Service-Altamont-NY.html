<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Altamont NY</h3>
<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and switch on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a nearby warm water faucet until you hear the gas burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke must be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the problem.</p>
<p>Changing a stopped working garbage disposer can appear overwhelming. There's the usual trepidation about electricity and water, the unfamiliar sink connection and enough drain fittings to make leaks a genuine possibility.

<p>When you turn your irrigation system on, it's an excellent concept to evaluate your backflow assembly every spring. However, we hardly ever suggest CPVC when an entire house needs repiping. The pipes can become brittle, over time, and might need replacement earlier than hoped.

Contact your state's licensing board to find out more.</p>

<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Sausalito CA</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow gadgets on an annual basis.

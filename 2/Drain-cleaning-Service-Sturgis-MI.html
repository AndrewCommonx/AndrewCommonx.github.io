Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this procedure if it doesn't work the first time. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>

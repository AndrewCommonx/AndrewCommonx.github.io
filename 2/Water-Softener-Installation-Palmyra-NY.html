<p>Basic water softeners found in house supply and hardware stores will get rid of almost all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening process. Softeners also will eliminate up to 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water supplies with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to lengthen the lifespan of a water softener. The effects of a malfunctioning toilet vary significantly-- from the moderate inconvenience of a tank that won't stop running to the potentially devastating and unhygienic back-up of unflushed sewage. No matter how big or small your toilet problems might be, Four Seasons Plumbing is here to help!

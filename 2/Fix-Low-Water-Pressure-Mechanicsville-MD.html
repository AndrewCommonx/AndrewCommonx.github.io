<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while liquified solids are caught and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>

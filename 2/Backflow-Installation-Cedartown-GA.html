<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>

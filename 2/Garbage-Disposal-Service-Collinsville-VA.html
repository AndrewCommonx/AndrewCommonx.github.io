<p>Difficult water stops washing cleaning agents and cosmetic cleansers from working as efficiently. When washing items are used in tough water - hard water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. It's a good idea to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience obstructions and backups in your house more than a few times. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>

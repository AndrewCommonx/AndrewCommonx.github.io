<p>The type of pipe you picked to replace your old pipes affects how much you'll pay. Expenses to load and haul away old products, installation waste and associated debris. Longstanding Blockages: Obstructions that continue after you have actually attempted to repair them call for professional assistance. Continued efforts on your own can hurt your lines, and you may have a more serious underlying problem than you are aware of. In addition, the longer you postpone to require professional assistance, the greater the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

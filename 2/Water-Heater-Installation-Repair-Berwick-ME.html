It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise needs to be located at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

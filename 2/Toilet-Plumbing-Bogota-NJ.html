The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>

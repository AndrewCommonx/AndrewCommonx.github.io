More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure might need changing the water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As an outcome, we recommend changing your unit if it is over ten years old. Under no circumstances must you ever attempt to fix gas leakages yourself.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>

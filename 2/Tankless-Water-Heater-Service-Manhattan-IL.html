There are sectors featuring Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing technicians in their day tasks at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal investigations on the show.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>

<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads become loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Tough water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these symptoms.</p>

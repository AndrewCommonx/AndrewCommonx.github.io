<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

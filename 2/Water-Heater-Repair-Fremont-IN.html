<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Bend OR</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

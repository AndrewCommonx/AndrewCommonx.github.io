Your hot water heater is dead when the tank leaks. The dead giveaway that your hot water heater needs replacing is a slow drip below, normally appearing as a trail of rusty water. This implies that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be repaired. Other symptoms, such as insufficient or no warm water, normally signal other hot water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

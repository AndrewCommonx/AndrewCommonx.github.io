<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

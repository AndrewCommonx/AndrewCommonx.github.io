<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system should be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

In a lot of states, except Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your home or organisation. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the very same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and pipes.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

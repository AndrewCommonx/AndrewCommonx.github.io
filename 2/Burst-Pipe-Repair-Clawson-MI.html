Big Blue Plumbing can manage the permit and acquire process. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be evaluated occasionally to ensure they are working appropriately. A visual check of air spaces suffices, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with appropriately adjusted gauge equipment.</p>

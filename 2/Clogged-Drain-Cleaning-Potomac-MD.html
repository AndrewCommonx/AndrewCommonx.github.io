<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Potomac MD</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to eliminate tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure referred to as Design template Assisted Formation (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't stay with any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and hot water heaters devoid of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners because they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And since these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>

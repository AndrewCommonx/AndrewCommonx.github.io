<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they usually happen in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is normally the result of an obstruction in the line. If you don't spot the odor coming from the sewer backup, you may identify this problem because a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security.

When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>

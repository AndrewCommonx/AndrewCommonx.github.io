<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try in Ridgeway VA</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

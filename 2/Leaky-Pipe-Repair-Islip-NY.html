A completely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into place. A safe seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached.

PEX is simple to install, which suggests the cost of installation may be low too. There is some risk of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is unusual.

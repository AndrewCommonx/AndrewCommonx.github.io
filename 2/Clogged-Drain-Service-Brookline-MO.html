<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds.

Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>

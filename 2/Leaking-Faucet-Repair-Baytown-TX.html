<p>Harts has incredible customer service and reacted immediately to our plumbing emergency! Chris has actually been to our home in the past and is professional and extremely knowledgeable. Harts is a great local company to deal with. How will you handle a severe clog after it obstructs a chemical drain cleaner? Blocked cleaner can create a poisonous swimming pool in your sink, making any new effort to clear it more harmful. If your disposal's installation will require a brand-new mounting flange in the sink, you'll need to install that first. If you're replacing an old disposer, remove it as discussed above.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the approach laid out above. Since the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

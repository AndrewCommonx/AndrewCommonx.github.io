<p>This ion exchange procedure is facilitated by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another mix that can work on sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can duplicate this procedure. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>

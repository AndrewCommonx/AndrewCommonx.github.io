<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>

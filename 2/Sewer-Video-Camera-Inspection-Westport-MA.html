If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety preventative measures you ought to require to safeguard yourself, your household and your house.

Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure once again exceeds the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

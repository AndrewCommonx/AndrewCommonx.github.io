Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
<p>An air pressure test is needed. The test pressure shall be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi).

Mechanical gauges utilized to determine test pressures will have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not greater than five times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test could be performed using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not suggest the minimum pressure needed for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as shown by pressure gauges throughout inspection will be deemed to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>

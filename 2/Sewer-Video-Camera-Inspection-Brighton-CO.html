<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>

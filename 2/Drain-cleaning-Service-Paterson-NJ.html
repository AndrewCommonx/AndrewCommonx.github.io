<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Paterson NJ</h3>
<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other disposing areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>

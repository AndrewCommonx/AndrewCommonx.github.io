<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>

If it was constructed before 1970, it might have pipes made from an outdated product that will begin to give you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not already).

<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated directly whenever it's needed. When the tap is switched on, tankless systems particularly make usage of an element that warms up water. The water is continually heated up as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature is generally pre-set to suit your requirements and choices. Because they just heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than standard water heaters.</p>

<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the a lot of part, a garbage disposal is only geared up to manage softer natural waste.

However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades. Use of a camera in your sewer line can help us much better diagnose sewer backups and sewer line and drain problems.

<p>If you spot a leak and go with a patching task rather of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same product and they may be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>

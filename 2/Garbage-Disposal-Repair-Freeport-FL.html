<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to bring back flow and avoid water collection on top of the structure's roofing.</p>

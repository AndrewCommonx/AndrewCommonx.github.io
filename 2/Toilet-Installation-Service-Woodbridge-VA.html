The lube must be a food grade lubricant to assure the water supply is not infected. Oftentimes the best lubricant is water. The usual use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be lightly lubricated to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to use or fail out faster by bring in dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the element.

<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal.

As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, however needs to then transition to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that must be. It is also allowed to use black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized covering (which is essentially an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E often does this.</p>

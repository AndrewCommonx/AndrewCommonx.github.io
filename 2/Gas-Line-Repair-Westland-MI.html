Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Design template Assisted Formation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a firmness crystal that will not stick to any surface in your house, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters without difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of captured ions.</p>

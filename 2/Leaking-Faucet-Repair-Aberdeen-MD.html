<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to get away. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>Take the example of the immediate hot shower that uses the point-of-use hot water heater; these home appliances will supply hot water continuously for the duration you are using the shower.

<p>After examining all of this details, you can decide whether you want to provide the exam.

<p>After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water devices? This is a good indication that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be replaced. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water only comes with hot water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>

<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. Newer systems utilize electronic sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other key metrics based upon your water use and for that reason only restore when required. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>

<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending upon the length from the main gas line. Installing a natural gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the backyard costs $300 to $1,400. If your water heater stops working due to sediment build up in the tank, you might have a problem with high water pressure. The water pressure builds and may eventually cause the tank to blow up. This triggers countless dollars in water and home damage to your house.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an event such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge till the supply side pressure again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to determine if and in some cases where a leak has taken place in systems which include gases and liquids. Most pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction includes security, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and services. The majority of apprentices go into a program directly, however some start out as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>

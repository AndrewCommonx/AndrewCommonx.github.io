<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it. When required, more recent systems utilize computerized sensing units that keep track of bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based on your water use and for that reason just regenerate. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>

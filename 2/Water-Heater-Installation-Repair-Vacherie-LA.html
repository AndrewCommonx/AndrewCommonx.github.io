<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>

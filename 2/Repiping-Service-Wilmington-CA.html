<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect in time, they slowly begin to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>

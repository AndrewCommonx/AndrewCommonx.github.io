<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked yearly. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked every year to guarantee the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.

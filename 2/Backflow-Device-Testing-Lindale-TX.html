<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is entirely odor free. The egg odor related to natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you need to take to safeguard yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.

<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

For that reason, you only include the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your computation. Many manufacturers do not have pressure loss details for vacuum breakers, so presume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no manufacturer's literature is readily available.</p>

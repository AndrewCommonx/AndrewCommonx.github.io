Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time.

Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are readily available. But they're harder to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>

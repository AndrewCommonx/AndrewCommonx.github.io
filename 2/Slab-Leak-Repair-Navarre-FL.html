<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

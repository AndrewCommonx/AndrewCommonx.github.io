<p>Small Leakages - A leak does not constantly mean that your hot water heater's going, it may just be condensation. But it also could mean that your tank welds or pipe fittings are used. If this holds true, a plumber is needed. When the majority of people think of plumbers, they usually call them for water pipe concerns. The gas plumber will have a license that states he or she is licensed to work on and install natural gas lines.

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>

A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

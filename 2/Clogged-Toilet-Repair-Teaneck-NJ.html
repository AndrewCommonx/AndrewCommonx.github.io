With a water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair issues, and have actually enhanced water heater efficiency also. The salt uptake through softened water depends on the solidity of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake originates from drinking softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

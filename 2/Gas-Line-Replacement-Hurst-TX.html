A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is occurring.

<p>0% APR 72 Months On Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Jobs. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however many homes developed between the 1930s - 1980s still have them.

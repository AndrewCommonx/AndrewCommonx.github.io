<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>Harts has remarkable customer support and reacted without delay to our plumbing emergency! Chris has actually been to our house in the past and is very knowledgeable and professional. Harts is a terrific local company to deal with. How will you handle a severe clog after it obstructs a chemical drain cleaner? Blocked cleaner can create a poisonous swimming pool in your sink, making any brand-new effort to clear it more harmful. If your disposal's installation will need a brand-new mounting flange in the sink, you'll need to install that initially. Eliminate it as discussed above if you're changing an old disposer.</p>
<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>

<p>The check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire protection industry, creating a redundancy developed to ensure that one check valve will continue to secure the city water supply even if the other fails. This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential throughout the other, producing a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leak. Test cocks, or little ball valves, make it possible for the attachment of testing equipment that assesses whether the check assembly is functional.</p>
<p>Tough water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing totally. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris.

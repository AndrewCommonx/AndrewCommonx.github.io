I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

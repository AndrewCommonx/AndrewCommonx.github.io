A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

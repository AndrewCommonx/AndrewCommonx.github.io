<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>

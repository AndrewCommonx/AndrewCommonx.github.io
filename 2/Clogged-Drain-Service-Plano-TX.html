<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

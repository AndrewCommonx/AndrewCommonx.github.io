These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds.

Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>

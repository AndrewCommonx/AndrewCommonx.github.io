<p>A PVB should be set up 12 inches above the greatest emission point. The advantage of this device is that you can install several zone valves in valve boxes underground after the device. Nevertheless, if there are several leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in a number of locations, it is probably time to repipe.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>For whole-house repiping, the choice typically boils down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is durable and more economical than copper. PEX is easy to install, which suggests the cost of installation may be low as well. There is some danger of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is unusual.

In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover impurities.</p>

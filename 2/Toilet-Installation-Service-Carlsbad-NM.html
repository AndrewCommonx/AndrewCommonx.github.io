These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

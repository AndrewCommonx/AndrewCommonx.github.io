<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down lead to a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and go with a patching task instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the exact same product and they might be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>

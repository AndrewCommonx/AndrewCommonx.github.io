The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if needed, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>

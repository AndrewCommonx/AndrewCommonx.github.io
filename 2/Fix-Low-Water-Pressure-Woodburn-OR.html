<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a common plumbing issue, and the majority of clogs can be solved with an easy fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. The concern can be a much deeper obstruction someplace in the main sewer line if the easy unclogging methods do not work to fix the slow drain. Unfortunately, mainline blockages are normally much larger clogs than require more than simple unclogging methods, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Inspect the washer for wear or fractures when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. However discovering the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be difficult to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has currently been fouled. Once again, it is advisable to inspect the maker's directions for special safety measures.</p>

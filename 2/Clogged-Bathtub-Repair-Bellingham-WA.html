<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver lady believed the price she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things differently could have conserved her a lot of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

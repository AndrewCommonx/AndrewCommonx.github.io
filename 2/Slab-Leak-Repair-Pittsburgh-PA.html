The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on.

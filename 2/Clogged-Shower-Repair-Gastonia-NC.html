<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Gastonia NC</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an exceptionally low circulation or static flow condition may cause annoyance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.

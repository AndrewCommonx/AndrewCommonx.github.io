Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should also be well maintained to assist prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in great shape.</p>

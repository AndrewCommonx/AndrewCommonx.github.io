A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).

<p>There are 2 popular mount systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you've had actually a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely installed this way) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the exact same job with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name indicates, the EZ Mount mechanism is meant to be easier to deal with when setting up or fixing an unit.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may have to look into using a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>

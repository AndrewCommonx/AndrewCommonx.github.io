While there's not a specific schedule as to when you should repipe your home, you must absolutely look into repiping if they have not been performed in 50 years or more-- particularly if you live in an older house constructed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather.

I would highly advise Hunter for any issues you might have.</p>

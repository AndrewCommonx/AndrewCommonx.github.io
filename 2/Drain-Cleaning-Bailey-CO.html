<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

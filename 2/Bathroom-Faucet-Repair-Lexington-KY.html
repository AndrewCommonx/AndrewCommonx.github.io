<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge in between guy and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to wiggle and jiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all severity however, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the inconvenience of those little day-to-day hassles - that the majority of people just live with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

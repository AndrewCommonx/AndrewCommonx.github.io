<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best first experience with the start of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic task for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will always use them and request George specifically for all future issues or repairs. They were prompt and offered great pricing for what we needed done. I extremely suggest this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Often a waste disposal unit merely stops to work and you can't figure out the cause. Garbage disposal problems can be credited to a variety of possible problems. The disposal might be clogged or jammed with a things that is challenging to understand or find, and numerous house owners watch out for attempting to fix a garbage disposal themselves (and for excellent reason!).

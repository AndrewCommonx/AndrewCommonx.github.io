In locations where there is very tough water, consumers can typically cut cleaning agent usage in dishwashing machines and washing makers by more than 50% after softening and get the same results. Our bathroom and kitchen sinks are something we consider granted till they start breaking down. And it so happens that our bathroom and kitchen sinks start acting up at the most bothersome times, like when we're having over dinner guests, or when we're running late for work in the early morning.</p>

Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate.</p>

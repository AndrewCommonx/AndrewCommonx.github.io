This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is required to conquer the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe sector of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>

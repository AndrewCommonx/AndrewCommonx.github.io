<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Larose LA</h3>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is just equipped to deal with softer organic waste. It could cause it to jam and not work effectively if bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal. By running warm water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

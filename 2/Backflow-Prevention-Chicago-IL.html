<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
<p>Obstructions are quickly avoided with a few crucial steps. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other debris before it gets stuck, preventing the need of drain cleaning. Although they don't catch everything, it helps the system substantially.

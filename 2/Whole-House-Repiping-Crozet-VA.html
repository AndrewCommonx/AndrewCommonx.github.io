<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

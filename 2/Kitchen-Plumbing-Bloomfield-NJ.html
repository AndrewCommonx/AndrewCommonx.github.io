It helps to understand the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand name is usually on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>

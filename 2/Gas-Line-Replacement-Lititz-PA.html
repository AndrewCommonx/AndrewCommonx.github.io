<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles however will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>

For example, you may live in an older home that included old pipes, or your pipes might be giving up because a previous owner used an unreliable fad" pipe.

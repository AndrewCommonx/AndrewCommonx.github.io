<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>

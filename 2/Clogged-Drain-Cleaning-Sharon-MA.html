<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>

<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we show, check the instructions. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

<p>Search for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>

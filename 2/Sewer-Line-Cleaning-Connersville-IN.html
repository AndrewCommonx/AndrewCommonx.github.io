<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system as the result of the downstream pressure being greater than the supply pressure.

Given that the average life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to acquire an extended warranty. Most warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures. To prevent more breakdowns, property owners need to keep up with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>

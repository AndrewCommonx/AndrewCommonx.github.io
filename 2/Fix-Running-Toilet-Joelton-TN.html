<p>Searching for timely Albuquerque emergency plumbing services? The 3rd main part of a water softening system is the salt water tank.

The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and should be renewed on a regular basis to ensure appropriate softening form the device.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water.

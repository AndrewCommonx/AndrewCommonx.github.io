If you do not detect the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this problem since a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, nevertheless, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated issue with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

If you can't find this wrench, then attempt to insert a broom manage or plunger into the sink drain opening and attempt to rotate the jammed flywheel. If it appears to be moving freely turn the system back on (and don't forget to turn back on the breaker if you do not it off) and see if the unit is working.</p>

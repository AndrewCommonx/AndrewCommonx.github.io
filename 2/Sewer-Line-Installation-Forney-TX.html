<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.

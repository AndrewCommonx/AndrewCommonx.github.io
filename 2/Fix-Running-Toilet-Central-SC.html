<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

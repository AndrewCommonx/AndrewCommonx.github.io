<p>Depending on the size of your house, repiping may take anywhere from a couple of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal interruption to your day-to-day regimen. To start the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will first cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and particles.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

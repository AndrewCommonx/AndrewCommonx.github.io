<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>

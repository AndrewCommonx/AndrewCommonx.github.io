<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in numerous locations have greatly minimized the number of reported occurrences that occur within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there might never really have actually been a concern in the very first place. This thinking can be both counterproductive and harmful. Backflow incidents in water supply are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow security.

Well, first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your home? If it was developed prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will begin to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't already). And if the house was constructed prior to The second world war, then it probably requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>If you have a more recent unit, a simple repair or replacing specific parts might be all that's needed to get your hot water heater working again.

While this may work in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, implying that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>

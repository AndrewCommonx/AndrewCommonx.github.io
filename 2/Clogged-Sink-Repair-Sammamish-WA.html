<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.

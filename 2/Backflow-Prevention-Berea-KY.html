<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Berea KY</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>With unique root nozzles, we can clean and clear most of the roots, rust, and debris to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe requires to be repaired.

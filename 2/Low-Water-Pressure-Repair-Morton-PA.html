I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

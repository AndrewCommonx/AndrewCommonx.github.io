<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that should also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to solidify and split or just be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak.

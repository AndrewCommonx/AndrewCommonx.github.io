A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

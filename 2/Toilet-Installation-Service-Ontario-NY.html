I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to likewise be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl.

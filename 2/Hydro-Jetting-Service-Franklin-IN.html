<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently becomes destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in locations where water sits for long periods of time.

Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>

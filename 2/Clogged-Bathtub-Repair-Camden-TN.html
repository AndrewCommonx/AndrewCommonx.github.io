<p>Regular causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, clogs (such as foreign things, toilet paper, grease, and other debris), degeneration, and broken seals or joints in between areas of sewer line. House owners are responsible for maintaining, fixing, and replacing gas pipes that run from the energy's gas meter to the home's natural gas devices. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a customer's gas pipe or associated connections, repair costs can be high.</p>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>

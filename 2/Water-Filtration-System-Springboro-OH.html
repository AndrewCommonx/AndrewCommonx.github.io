And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>

Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water in fact requires it. When required, more recent systems utilize electronic sensors that monitor bead deficiency and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>

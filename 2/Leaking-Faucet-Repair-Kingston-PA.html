<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are ending up being more and more typical, as both makers and consumers look for new methods to save water. Dual flush toilets permit the user to select the level of water required to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is liquid or solid. We have actually all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people find that squicky - therefore the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're simply utilizing less water to do it.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

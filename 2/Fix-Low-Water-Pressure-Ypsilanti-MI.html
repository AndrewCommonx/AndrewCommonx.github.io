<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid normally will help remove them. If you would like to try the gentlest technique possibly try using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and safety cautions first!), if that doesn't do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust spots and it's readily available at many hardware shops.</p>

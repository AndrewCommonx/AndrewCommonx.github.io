This has at times led to individuals believing that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever truly have been a concern in the very first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and unsafe. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow protection.

They are non-testable and are generally utilized by water companies and set up after a water meter to prevent the meter from running backwards and low protection against backflow.

<p>Backflow prevention steps should be maintained on-site at all times during construction. Short-lived water will be permitted after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker need to be connected to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be firmly attached to strong rebar or wooden stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially complete is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away tested to ensure it is working.</p>

<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the beginning of our house enhancements. George and Anthony did an incredible job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our home.

<p>The term tough water" might sound like an oxymoron, but it's merely household water which contains high concentrations of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals don't make water unhealthy to consume. They likewise are fairly undetected through smell or taste, however they can be harmful just the same. Just like our trenchless services, we will first conduct pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. The majority of residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>

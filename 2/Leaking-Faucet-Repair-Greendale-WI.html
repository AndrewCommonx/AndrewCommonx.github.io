We highly suggest repiping your house throughout spring or summer so you do not have to stress about freezing temperatures throughout the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment.

Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners because they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it.

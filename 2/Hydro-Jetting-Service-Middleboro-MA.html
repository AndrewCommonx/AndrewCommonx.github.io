<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decline in provided pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to leave.

<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is designed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "regular," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water entering the drinkable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic material, which suggests germs will not grow on it. Copper has actually been used (in addition to PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is specifically helpful for cold and hot tap water and refrigerant lines in A/C systems.</p>
<p>If you identify a leak and select a patching job instead of a repiping task, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the very same material and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
